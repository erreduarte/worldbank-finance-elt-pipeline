### Data Overview

This section provides an overview of the outcome data processed during the project. The folder contains three files that demonstrate the data at different stages:

1. ![WB_Data_Loans_Bronze][/.data_view/WB_Data_Loans__Bronze.csv]: This file contains the raw data extracted from the World Bank API, stored in blob files without any transformations.
   
2. ![WB_Data_Loans_Silver]: This file includes the transformed data, where unnecessary characters were removed and additional aggregated columns were introduced.
   
3. ![Database_View]: A sample result of the final database query, illustrating how the transformed data was loaded into the database and can be queried.
